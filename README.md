# QuizBowl
A training program for a single individual. Initially, the program will ask the user to enter their first and last name, followed by the name of the file storing the questions and answers for his/her training session. (The format of this file is discussed later in the document). Then, the program should ask the user how many questions they would like to practice. (The program prompts the user with the maximum allowed, based on how many questions were in the input file they entered). The program is able to gracefully handle a situation where the user doesn't enter a valid value or token (Input Validation). Then, the program prompts the user with the number of random questions from this database that they requested.
